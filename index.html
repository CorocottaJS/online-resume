    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h3>The purpose of this new project is to radically change my career path. For personal reasons, I moved from my country (Spain) to a completely diferent one (Japan). Having studied a degree in History, there is not a lot of work related to my current background, and I have been working in the Fast Food industry. <br>I have been always interested in the IT area, but I considered it out of my reach. Now, however, I think I can create a new carrer in this area, which is the reason I am starting this portfolio, in order to show my new skills and change my life.</h3>
