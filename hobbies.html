<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<hr />
<h3>Currently, my main hobbie is photography. Until december, i had to use a very old camera, an Olympus e520, but in January, I was able to buy a new camera, a second hand Sony a7RIII, and a couple of lenses.<br />Apart from that, I also enjoy traveling, reading a good book and watchig a movie. And of course, reading about history, my grand passion.</h3>
 <h3>Here you can enjoy some of my photographs.</h3>
